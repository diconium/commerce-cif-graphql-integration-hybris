        "html": "With the EOS 500D, every side of your story comes alive. Capture every detail in stunning 15.1 Megapixel resolution, or switch to shooting pin-sharp Full High Definition video.<br/><br/><b>15.1 MP CMOS sensor</b><br/>Ideal for those who want to create large, poster-size prints – or crop images to perfection without losing any of the detail necessary for printing – Canon’s 15.1MP CMOS sensor is outstanding in low light, and produces images with incredibly low noise.<br/><br/><b>Full HD movie recording</b><br/>The EOS 500D combines exceptional still shooting with the ability to shoot Full HD (1080p) video. For occasions when larger amounts of footage need to be stored on a memory card, users can also choose to shoot at 720p or VGA resolution. An HDMI connection allows High Definition playback of footage and images on any HDTV. <br/><br/><b>High ISO for low light</b><br/>When light levels fall, the EOS 500D offers an ISO range of up to 3200 – expandable to 12800 for those environments where using flash is undesirable. <br/><br/><b>3.4fps with up to 170 JPEG burst</b><br/>The EOS 500D features shooting speeds of up to 3.4fps in continuous bursts of up to 170 large JPEG images (9 RAW). <br/><br/><b>3.0” Clear View LCD with Live View mode</b><br/>Detailed checks on images and video are possible with a 3.0” ClearView LCD screen, which features an ultra-high 920,000 dots for increased clarity. Switch to Live View mode and use the real-time visual feed to shoot from awkward angles.<br/><br/><b>9-point AF system</b><br/>A high-precision AF system employs 9 AF points AF Points are located throughout the frame to better accommodate off-centre subjects. For accurate focusing with fast aperture lenses, the central AF point features a high sensitivity cross-type sensor, suitable for lenses with an aperture of f/2.8 or faster.<br/><br/><b>DIGIC 4</b><br/>Canon’s DIGIC 4 processor works with the CMOS sensor to deliver 14-bit image processing, for smooth gradations and natural looking colours. DIGIC 4 also powers advanced Noise Reduction when shooting at higher ISO speeds, plus split-second startup times and near-instant image review after shooting.<br/><br/><b>EOS Integrated Cleaning System</b><br/>Canon’s built-in dust prevention system offers three ways of guarding images against the effects of dust: reduction of internal dust generation"

        "html": "<b>The EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM, part of Canon’s prestigious L series, and first featuring an Image Stabilizer with angle and shift detection that is highly effective at close focusing distances.</b><br/><br/><b>L series Quality</b><br/>The lens embodies Canon's highest standards of L-series optics, build quality, reliability and operability. A robust construction includes dust and moisture resistant seals to protect against harsh weather conditions.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid Image Stabilizer</b><br/>The new Image Stabilizer designed specifically for inclusion in a macro lens. It is able to correct lens shift movement as well as the angular movement that most IS systems can correct. This provides 2-stops of correction during 1.0x magnification, increasing to 3-stops at 0.5x magnification and 4-stops during normal shooting.<br/><br/><b>Ultra low dispersion (UD) lens element ensures high image quality</b><br/>A UD element within the lens design effectively removes chromatic aberration. This allows for excellent image quality with high resolution, high contrast and excellent colour reproduction.<br/><br/><b>Focus limiter switch</b><br/>To enhance the photographer’s use of the lens, it is fitted with a 3 position focus limiter switch. With limits for close up subjects, distant subjects and all subjects, the user is able to increase the autofocus speed making quick shots a possibility.<br/><br/><b>Beautiful background blur with 9 blade circular aperture</b><br/>A circular blade aperture helps to create attractive, even background bokeh when isolating subjects at wide apertures.<br/><br/><b>Fast quiet auto focus</b><br/>The ring USM (Ultrasonic Motor) drives extremely rapid auto focus with near-silent operation. Full time mechanical manual focus override is available without having to switch out of AF. The lens offers a minimum focusing distance of 0.3m."
